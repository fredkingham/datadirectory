Prescribing Analytics,http://www.prescribinganalytics.com/,"We combined raw prescription data with expert guidance from qualified doctors and medical researchers, cross-checked against NICE guidelines and other best practice, to develop reasonable assumptions about where prescribing choices may be driving excess spending. We investigated statins as the first area to look at, since the guidance is generally straightforward in that area and well-documented: in almost all cases, generic simvastatin is the recommended best-value option, and is enormously cheaper than branded alternatives.

We identified drugs that only appear in branded formulations (atorvastatin and rosuvastatin calcium) and conservatively assumed that doctors would always have prescribed the cheaper generic form where it exists in any other case - for example, Pravastatin Sodium comes in both branded and generic forms.

We chose to show percentage of total statin items which are definitely branded (atorvastatin/rosuvastatin) as a key measure, since a high branded percentage would tend to show an opportunity for savings.

'Potential savings' were calculated as the amount which would be saved if these branded items were switched to Simvastatin 40mg. We ran the analysis to May 2012 only, as the price of atorvastatin dropped at that point when the drug went off-patent. However, this doesn’t mean that prescribing is a historical problem: there are multiple categories of potential savings, which statins are just an illustration for. For example, an article in the British Medical Journal suggested a £1.4bn annual savings potential from looking across 10 classes of drugs rather than just the one that we’ve covered here.","This matters for two reasons. First, our findings should ring alarm bells about how doctors in England make choices about how they prescribe. We discuss this below.

Second, money available for healthcare is not limitless. Wasteful spending on unnecessary expensive drugs mean that, elsewhere in the NHS, patients are missing out. Maybe another nurse could be employed or a patient could be given a treatment that is currently unaffordable.

Dr James Moon, a cardiologist, has calculated that the NHS could save £1.4bn per year if doctors switched patients from expensive medicines to cheap ones that are just as good.",Prescribing Analytics,"This site is the first joint venture of a group of NHS doctors, academics, and London tech start-ups, individually listed below, who met at NHS Hack Day.

Which doctors take up promising ideas?,http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/which-doctors-take-promising-ideas-new-insights-open-data,"The report looks at early adoption of promising new ideas across primary care in England and argues that analysing open data can help public services gain a greater understanding of their take up of innovations.

Key findings

No single group of GP practices were serial early adopters of all the innovations reviewed, but groups of early adopters were identified around specific types of innovations.
Larger GP practices are in a better position to explore and introduce new innovations, while neighbouring practices tended to have similar rates and patterns of adopting new innovations.
GPs rely on a range of resources to identify and learn about innovations – including informal local networks, personal relationships, and information systems. Fellow GPs and national guidance were particularly influential sources of information.
Local intermediaries – such as Academic Health Science Networks and Clinical Commissioning Groups – have an important role to play in the adoption process.","This report demonstrates a rising opportunity to inform practitioners and patients by making use of open data. Analysis of primary care open data shows the potential to chart GP surgeries’ uptake of promising innovations in technologies, drugs and practices.

Using open data, this report charts where, when and which GP practices across England have taken-up promising innovations. As well as showing the varied uptake of certain proven drugs, technologies and practices by GP surgeries, the report explores how making use of open data can help people understand trends and differences in service within primary care, and inform patient and practitioner priorities and choices.

The report is based on the analysis of open datasets from the Health and Social Care Information Centre, demographic data, as well as qualitative and quantitative research.

clinical calculator API,https://github.com/open-health-hub/clinical_calculator_api,"We created a REST API which conceals some of the complexity of open data, by removing some of the need to understand the document structure, geographical jargon, and clinical meaning of the raw open data, and enabling simple access to  relevant portions of the data.

As an example, the open data on prevalence of obesity is available as a large Excel file from http://www.noo.org.uk/visualisation. It's organised by region, by LSOA, and MSOA, and by electoral ward (geographical jargon). We felt that many people would want to search by postcode, in order to discover the prevalence of obesity in their area. We therefore used MySociety's MapIt postcode data API https://mapit.mysociety.org/ to return the Ward/MSOA/LSOA for a given postcode, and them used this to look up the relevant information and return it as a JSON response.

Clinical Calculator API also provides height centile, weight centile and BMI centile data, used for assessing child growth, general health, and (increasingly) obesity.

Living a Long Life?,https://www.thersa.org/action-and-research/rsa-projects/public-services-and-communities-folder/mental-health/long-life.html/,"
RSA OPSN collated publically available data and worked with academic colleagues at the University of Surrey to band CCGs based on the experiences of mental health service users in their area. RSA OPSN have banded them ‘low’, ‘as expected’ and ‘high’ based on our expected outcomes adjusted for population. While these bandings provide an important basis of understanding national trends and where particular attention is required, it is important to note whether ‘as expected’, ‘low’ or ‘high’, across all indicators and all bandings, the gap between mental health service users and the rest of the population is stark and concerning.

The data we have found confirms and specifies in greater detail the differing quality as and outcome of life for those with poor mental health. We have found across the country that those with mental illnesses are more likely to die earlier and more like to get treated differently by health care professionals.

Mapping English GP prescribing data,http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/1/e001363.full,"Objective The aim of this paper was to show that easily interpretable maps of local and national prescribing data, available from open sources, can be used to demonstrate meaningful variations in prescribing performance.

Design The prescription dispensing data from the National Health Service (NHS) Information Centre for the medications metformin hydrochloride and methylphenidate were compared with reported incidence data for the conditions, diabetes and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, respectively. The incidence data were obtained from the open source general practitioner (GP) Quality and Outcomes Framework. These data were mapped using the Ordnance Survey CodePoint Open data and the data tables stored in a PostGIS spatial database. Continuous maps of spending per person in England were then computed by using a smoothing algorithm and areas whose local spending is substantially (at least fourfold) and significantly (p<0.05) higher than the national average are then highlighted on the maps.","Results The spatial mapping demonstrates that several areas in England have substantially and significantly higher spending per person on metformin and methyphenidate. North Kent and the Wirral have substantially and significantly higher spending per child on methyphenidate.

Conclusions It is possible, using open source data, to use statistical methods to distinguish chance fluctuations in prescribing from genuine differences in prescribing rates. The results can be interactively mapped at a fine spatial resolution down to individual GP practices in England. This process could be automated and reported in real time. This can inform decision-making and could enable earlier detection of emergent phenomena.",Dr Peter J Diggle,,* [Prescribing data ](http://www.hscic.gov.uk/gpprescribingdata) is from the monthly files published by the HSCIC,http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/1/e001363/F7.medium.gif,prescribing,

Parkinson's Disease Measurement,http://www.parkinsonsmeasurement.org/Epidemiology/EnglandPrescription/prevalenceEngland1.htm#maps,"
This paper presents maps of the inferred relative prevalence of PD in England. The maps are based on data from publicly accessible data sets:

* one that contains for each of the 10,000 GP practices in England the number of NHS prescriptions written for each drug in June 2012;

* one that shows the post code of each practice;

*one that shows the eastings and northings of each post code.

The data does not explicitly mention PD, so we adopt a proxy measure. This is based on the observation that some drugs, such as levodopa, are associated with PD. The ratio between the number of ""Parkinson's"" prescriptions written by a practice and the total number of prescriptions that it writes gives an indication of the prevalence of PD in that practice's catchment areas. We go one stage further, we derive our proxy measure by dividing a practice's ratio by the national average ratio. This gives the inferred relative prevalence for that practice. It is from these values that the maps are drawn.",,John Turner,,* [Prescribing data ](http://www.hscic.gov.uk/gpprescribingdata) is from the monthly files published by the HSCIC,http://www.parkinsonsmeasurement.org/Epidemiology/EnglandPrescription/prevalenceEngland1_00_50_50_75_100_H500.gif,"parkinsons,mapping,prescribing",

Student Data Labs,http://studentdatalabs.com/,"In February Student Data Labs ran a Health Innovation Lab as part of the Leeds Digital Festival at the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics. The aim here was to teach practical data science skills whilst tackling Type 2 Diabetes in Leeds. Open health data and Leeds-based organisations like the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), who have one of the largest repositories of open data in Europe, were integral to the success of the Lab. We are very lucky to be based in a city that is at the forefront of the open health data revolution. All of our projects made use of data that is open and freely available for anyone to download. For some university students, the Health Innovation Lab was the first time they had made use of open data. This provided us with the opportunity to demonstrate the huge potential of open health data for building innovative tools and discovering valuable insights that can potentially save lives.","Through the Health Innovation, university students were given the opportunity to learn real world data skills and do some good along the way. The practical nature of the Labs enabled university students from all backgrounds to get involved with civic data projects. Some of these data projects went on to become more long-term. For example, one of our practical exercises involved using open prescription data to forecast demand for Diabetes medication across the city. Another mapped the prevalence of Diabetes at CCG level in England. 

The Health Innovation Lab saw Student Data Labs collaborate with a variety of amazing organisations in the region from digital innovation agencies like mHealth Habitat to Leeds Data Mill, the HSCIC and Leeds Beckett. Our ultimate aim is to create social impact with the data projects and we're working with dynamic and innovative organisations to try and make this happen.",Student Data Labs,"Based in Leeds and established in November 2015, Student Data Labs envisions a future where more university students can gain highly sought-after data skills that prepare them for entering the labour market upon graduation.

The excersize would take place at local council sports centres, generating £1m per year for the council in class fees. Our suggestion was to also include a practice nurse at the sports classes to not only help patients, but to also take regular readings from patients (fitbit, bloods, weight, etc) to feed back into the system.","The insight was well received by Bradford CCG's, and by the senior leadership team at Bradford Council and we are hoping to work closely to create a pilot project.",Data Flock,Data Flock provide expert data insight for organisations and companies who want to use information to further their goals.,"* [Prescribing data](http://digital.nhs.uk/gpprescribingdata)
