orgdescription: "This site is the first joint venture of a group of NHS doctors, academics, and London tech start-ups, individually listed below, who met at NHS Hack Day. We love open data, technology, and the NHS, and we think that bringing all of these together in the right way could be amazing. Email us at info@prescribinganalytics.com if you’d like to talk."
impact: "This matters for two reasons. First, our findings should ring alarm bells about how doctors in England make choices about how they prescribe. We discuss this below.

Second, money available for healthcare is not limitless. Wasteful spending on unnecessary expensive drugs mean that, elsewhere in the NHS, patients are missing out. Maybe another nurse could be employed or a patient could be given a treatment that is currently unaffordable.

Dr James Moon, a cardiologist, has calculated that the NHS could save £1.4bn per year if doctors switched patients from expensive medicines to cheap ones that are just as good."

description: "We combined raw prescription data with expert guidance from qualified doctors and medical researchers, cross-checked against NICE guidelines and other best practice, to develop reasonable assumptions about where prescribing choices may be driving excess spending. We investigated statins as the first area to look at, since the guidance is generally straightforward in that area and well-documented: in almost all cases, generic simvastatin is the recommended best-value option, and is enormously cheaper than branded alternatives.

We identified drugs that only appear in branded formulations (atorvastatin and rosuvastatin calcium) and conservatively assumed that doctors would always have prescribed the cheaper generic form where it exists in any other case - for example, Pravastatin Sodium comes in both branded and generic forms.

We chose to show percentage of total statin items which are definitely branded (atorvastatin/rosuvastatin) as a key measure, since a high branded percentage would tend to show an opportunity for savings.

'Potential savings' were calculated as the amount which would be saved if these branded items were switched to Simvastatin 40mg. We ran the analysis to May 2012 only, as the price of atorvastatin dropped at that point when the drug went off-patent. However, this doesn’t mean that prescribing is a historical problem: there are multiple categories of potential savings, which statins are just an illustration for. For example, an article in the British Medical Journal suggested a £1.4bn annual savings potential from looking across 10 classes of drugs rather than just the one that we’ve covered here."
