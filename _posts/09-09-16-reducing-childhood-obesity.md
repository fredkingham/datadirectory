description: "We looked at data relating to Childhood Obesity, taking data from a range of sources to find trends in the data, with a final focus on Bradford. Looking at the national picture we found that only 138 wards out of 7,618 wards in England had reduced the levels of childhood obesity from when children start primary school to when they finish, aged 10/11.

Looking at 2008/09 data when children start in reception class (aged 5) the average rate of obesity across the country is 9.323%. When the same children finish primary school in 2013/14 (aged 10/11), their average rate of obesity has risen to 17.969%. In Ilkeston central council ward, in Erewash Borough Council childhood obesity rose from 5% to 32.6% within 6 years. We found that this wasn't an anomaly as there were 68 other wards whose childhood obesity rates have increased by more than 400%."
